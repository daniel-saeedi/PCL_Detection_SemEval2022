# What is Patronizing and Condescending Language (PCL)?
We all are patronizing and condescending sometimes. And of course, we all are susceptible to be condescended and patronized by others. But some groups are, unfortunately, more used to be referred to with this undervaluing treatment. The so-called vulnerable communities seem to be the perfect target for charity and pity-driven texts, condescension and patronization in news stories.



PCL is often involuntary and unconscious and the authors using such language are usually trying to help the communities in need, by raising awareness, moving the audience to action or standing for the rights of the under-represented. But PCL can potentially be very harmful, as it feeds tereotypes, routinizes discrimination and drives to greater exclusion.
