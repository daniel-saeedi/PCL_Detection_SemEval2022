# SemEval2022 Patronizing and Condescending Language (PCL) Detection
This task is from [SemEval 2022](https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2022/).

# What is Patronizing and Condescending Language (PCL)?
We all are patronizing and condescending sometimes. And of course, we all are susceptible to be condescended and patronized by others. But some groups are, unfortunately, more used to be referred to with this undervaluing treatment. The so-called vulnerable communities seem to be the perfect target for charity and pity-driven texts, condescension and patronization in news stories.



PCL is often involuntary and unconscious and the authors using such language are usually trying to help the communities in need, by raising awareness, moving the audience to action or standing for the rights of the under-represented. But PCL can potentially be very harmful, as it feeds tereotypes, routinizes discrimination and drives to greater exclusion.

## Abstract

> Fill later

## Software implementation

> Briefly describe the software that was written to produce the results of this
> paper.

All source code used to generate the results and figures in the paper are in
the `code` folder.
The calculations and figure generation are all run inside
[Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/).
The data used in this study is available [upon request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5KyzXgpnEOjS-Y6Gb8TTKiWxh4_qLuPL-NGiqKCyF41ALlg/viewform).

## Getting the code

You can download a copy of all the files in this repository by cloning the
[git](https://git-scm.com/) repository:

    git clone https://github.com/pinga-lab/PAPER-REPO.git

or [download a zip archive](https://github.com/pinga-lab/PAPER-REPO/archive/master.zip).


## Dependencies

You'll need a working Python environment to run the code.
The recommended way to set up your environment is through the
[Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) which
provides the `conda` package manager.
Anaconda can be installed in your user directory and does not interfere with
the system Python installation.
The required dependencies are specified in the file `environment.yml`.

We use `conda` virtual environments to manage the project dependencies in
